# P-OS

P-OS is a simple operating system written from scratch, this is mainly for learning and fun.

My goals:

- Enter Long Mode and start making the kernel in 64-bit mode in C.
- Recreate C certain standard library functions
- Build the shell
- Implement a simple file system
- Implement my own intepreted language (Dosato)[https://github.com/Robotnik08/cdosato]
- Allow the user to load, make and run dosato programs
